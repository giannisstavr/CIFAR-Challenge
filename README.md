In this repo is the model architecture used to achieve an acurracy of 80%+ on the CIFAR classification challenge. 
The methodology used in order to reach the architecture can be found on the attached pdf. 
Briefly, the archicture makes uses of transfer learning along with strong penelisation techniques such as mix-up to avoid overfitting. 
The layers for the classification part of the model were selected based on the search algoruthm: Keras Tuner, whoose architecture also may be seen in the repo.
